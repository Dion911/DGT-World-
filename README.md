# One Paragon – PWA Flipbook

This is an offline-ready PWA that displays the PNG pages as a swipeable flipbook.

How to use:
1) Serve this folder using any local server (for offline cache to work).
2) Deploy to GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages) using the branch/folder you pushed.

Notes:
- First load needs internet; after that it works offline.
- To update pages, replace files in assets/pages and redeploy.
